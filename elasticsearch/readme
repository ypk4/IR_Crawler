1)Download LAMP stack for drupal configuration using sudo apt-get install lamp-server^
2)download drupal 7.56 and put it in the /var/www/html directory
3)now, the drupal installation should look like /var/www/html/drupal
(drupal-7.56.zip when extracted, I have renamed the folder to drupal)
4)access localhost/drupal on the browser
5)copy elasticsearch folder to /var/www/html/drupal/sites/all/modules
6)after copying, go to modules menue in drupal installation (using browser : localhost/drupal).
7)check the elasticsearch checkbox and then go to Configuration->performance->clear cache
8)Then visit localhost/drupal/elasticsearch/search page to see this search page in action.
(if step 8 doesn't work, use following url:)
localhost/drupal/?q=elasticsearch/search
